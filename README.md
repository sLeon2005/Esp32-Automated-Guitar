# ESP32-S3 Automated Guitar

An **ESP32-S3-based automated acoustic guitar** that physically plays programmed melodies using **servomotors and solenoids**, combining embedded systems, mechanical design, and digital music representation.

This project transforms a standard acoustic guitar into a **mechatronic musical instrument**, capable of executing predefined songs stored on a microSD card through real mechanical actuation.

## 🎸 Project Overview

Unlike digital synthesizers or MIDI-only systems, this project produces sound by **directly interacting with a real guitar**:

- **Solenoids** press the frets to define the pitch  
- **Servomotors** strum the strings  
- An **ESP32-S3** coordinates timing, actuation, and song execution  
- Songs are stored as simple text-based note sequences on a **microSD card**

The entire system is **non-invasive**, meaning it can be mounted and removed without permanently modifying or damaging the guitar.

Songs are selected via **DIP switches**, allowing up to 8 different melodies without reflashing the firmware.

## ⚙️ Mechanical Design

### Fretting Mechanism (Solenoids)

- Linear solenoids mounted along the guitar neck  
- Each solenoid presses an entire fret when activated  
- Compact, fast, and mechanically simple  
- Designed to minimize noise and excessive force

### Strumming Mechanism (Servomotors)

- One servomotor per string  
- Alternating motion simulates real strumming  
- Adjustable mounting system using linear rods  
- Non-invasive and fully removable  

All mechanical components were **custom-designed and 3D printed (PLA)**.

## 🔌 Electronics

The system is built around an **ESP32-S3**, selected for its performance, GPIO count, and PWM capabilities.

**Main components:**
- ESP32-S3 microcontroller  
- MicroSD card module (SPI)  
- Solenoids (fretting)  
- SG90 servomotors (strumming)  
- NeoPixel LEDs for visual feedback  
- Dedicated 5 V and 3.3 V power regulation

## 🧩 Firmware Overview

The firmware is written using the Arduino framework for **ESP32-S3** and focuses on **deterministic timing and reliable actuation**.

### Key Concepts

- **Note abstraction**:
  - MIDI-like note ID  
  - Associated solenoid  
  - Associated servo channel  

- **Text-based song format**:
<note_midi>,<duration_ms>

- Servo position alternation to avoid double strumming  
- Conditional solenoid activation for open strings  
- Hardware-based song selection via DIP switches  

This approach avoids full MIDI parsing while preserving musical flexibility and embedded reliability.
